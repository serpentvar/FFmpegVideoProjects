# FFmpegVideoProjects

## Introduction

This repository houses a collection of FFmpeg scripts designed to automate a variety of video editing tasks. Simply drag and drop your video files onto the respective scripts to easily crop, scale, overlay, and apply other effects to your videos.

## Requirements

- FFmpeg: Install the latest version from [ffmpeg.org](https://ffmpeg.org/download.html)
- (Optional) NVIDIA GPU: Some scripts in this repository make use of FFmpeg with NVIDIA hardware acceleration. A compatible NVIDIA GPU is needed for those specific scripts.

## Installation

1. Clone this repository.
2. Make sure FFmpeg is installed and added to your PATH environment variable.
3. Just drag and drop your video files onto the respective .bat file

## Usage

To use the scripts in this repository, you don't need to manually run any commands. Just drag and drop your video files onto the respective scripts to execute the corresponding actions.

## Running on Non-Windows Systems

This repository primarily contains Windows batch files (.bat), which are designed to run natively on Windows systems. However, if you wish to use them on Linux or macOS, you have several options:

### Convert to Shell Script
1. Manually convert the `.bat` files to Shell scripts (.sh).
2. Use Shell commands to perform the same operations.

### Use Wine on Linux
You can use the Wine compatibility layer to run Windows applications on Linux.
1. Install Wine
   ```
   sudo apt install wine
   ```
2. Run the batch file
   ```
   wine cmd /c your-script.bat
   ```

### Use a Virtual Machine or Docker
1. Create a Windows virtual machine or container.
2. Run the batch files inside the virtual environment.

### Use Cross-platform Scripting Languages
You could also rewrite these batch files using a cross-platform language like Python, Ruby, or Node.js to make them compatible with other operating systems.
